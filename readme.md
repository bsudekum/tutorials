You can either follow along on github.com or download the files and view them on your machine ([download](https://github.com/bsudekum/tutorials/archive/gh-pages.zip)). Unzip and `cd` to the folder. You will need to serve up the files here are two methods:

##### [`serve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)

* Install via `npm install -g serve`
* Usage: `serve`
* Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

##### `SimpleHTTPServer`

* Usage: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
* Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

If you are not able to serve up the files, you can unzip the folder and open each `index.html` in a browser (not recommended).
